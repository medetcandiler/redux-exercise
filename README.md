# Next.js Application with Redux Toolkit

This project is a Next.js application created to practice using Redux Toolkit. It allows users to nominate their favorite films or series and incorporates various technologies and libraries. The project utilizes Next.js router system for navigation and leverages React Hook Form with Yup for form validation. Material-UI components are used for building the user interface. The project aims to showcase the integration of Redux Toolkit for state management, Next.js for routing, and the usage of form validation with React Hook Form and Yup.

## Features

- **Redux Toolkit**: Simplifies state management, actions, and reducers for seamless integration with Next.js, providing an efficient and scalable solution for managing application state.

- **Next.js**: Employs server-side rendering for improved performance, optimized routing, and enhanced user experience, ensuring fast and responsive page transitions.

- **React Hook Form and Yup**: Enables easy and efficient form handling and validation, ensuring robust data entry and user-friendly error handling, promoting data integrity and user satisfaction.

- **Next.js Routing**: Utilizes Next.js router system for smooth navigation between different sections of the application, ensuring a seamless and cohesive user journey.

- **Tailwind CSS**: Accelerates UI development with customizable styling options, enabling rapid prototyping and creating visually appealing interfaces.

- **Material-UI Components**: Integrates pre-designed components from Material-UI, offering consistent and polished UI elements, enhancing the overall look and feel of the application.

- **useEffect**: Manages side effects, such as fetching data from local storage to persist user-selected movies, allowing for dynamic updates and seamless user experience.

## ABOUT ME 
I am delighted that you have taken an interest in my project. At 26 years old, I hold a degree in mechanical engineering. Following graduation, I spent approximately five months working as an engineer in a specific field. However, during this time, I realized that the role did not align with my aspirations and overall satisfaction.

Driven by my passion for coding, software, and computer components, I extensively researched various career options, ultimately gravitating towards web development. The more I delved into this field, the stronger my interest grew. I became determined to excel as a talented frontend web developer. Notably, my engineering background has equipped me with highly organized and systematic work habits, facilitating effective learning and contributing significantly to my educational journey.

I hope this brief introduction has provided you with insight into my background and motivations without becoming overly tedious.
